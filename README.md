# letsBlog


## Description

The motivation for the project was to create a blog site where you can host blog posts
I wanted to allow the user to post blogs and view other blogs
This solved the problem of wanting to connect with other coders and learn and teach about coding

## Installation

This website was built from scratch following the MVC structure

## Usage
